          %h2.card-title Biography
          %p.card-text I was born in South Carolina, though I now call Tennessee home. I have Welsh ancestry through my father's side and Puerto-Rican ancestry through my mother's side. My political beliefs could be characterized as paleo-conservative, and I am a Christian, raised as a Pentecostal and baptized as a Primitive Baptist--though I would hesitate to label myself as anything other than "Reformed" now. For the most part, I agree with the doctrine as expounded by Augustine and Calvin, and I personally prefer a simple worship service consisting of hymns and prayer. For leisure, I enjoy baseball, firearms, reading, writing, chess, and D&amp;D.
          %p.card-text I served in the United States Army Infantry for 5 years, deploying twice to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF X-XI and OEF XIII) both as a Soldier and an NCO. I am a recipient of the highly-coveted Combat Infantryman's Badge, Expert Marksmanship Badge with Rifle Bar, Air Assault Badge, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 2 Campaign Stars, Army Commendation Medal with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achievement Medal, Nato Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Overseas Service Ribbon, and Army Service Ribbon. During my service with 1-506th IN Regt (Red Currahee), we distinguished ourselves by earning a Valorous Unit Award and a Meritorious Unit Citation.
          %p.card-text I began formally studying Computer Science and Information Systems after completing my term of military service. A GNU/Linux user from the time that my parents gave me my first computer as a young teenager, I am committed to free and open source software; over the past several years, I have authored a few Ruby gems which are released under various open source licenses. Amongst others, my technical competencies include Ruby, Rails, HTML, HAML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript (ES2015), Postgresql, and more. It is my sincere hope that my contributions to the open source software community will glorify God and prove useful to my fellow engineers.
